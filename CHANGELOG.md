## [1.0.23] 2024-8-5

### Added

- `LogFileFolder` parameter to `Invoke-HelmUpgrade`, `Get-DeploymentStatus`, `Get-JobStatus`, `Get-PodStatus`, and `Write-PodLog`
- `--wait` to helm rollback
- `ToString` to `PodStatus` class for better viewing of the output object

### Fixed

- Handle case when duplicate env vars of different case and JSON conversion fails

## [1.0.21] 2024-7-15

### Fixed

- Erroring out in case when no events are returned from a pod, which may be valid

### Updated

- `Get-PodStatus` has better handling for scheduling errors, such as taints, memory, etc.
- Logging improvements:
  - Footer always matches the header now
  - Use box drawing characters in header and footer to be cleaner
  - Removed output file logging code since `Start-Transcript` works fine
  - Removed timestamps for `TF_BUILD` environment since it's already in the log

## [1.0.18] 2024-7-12

### Added

- Get-JobStatus added to check the status of a K8s job

- Get-PodStatus uses deployment's revision instead of creationTimestamp to get the current rs since rollback may make an older one active

- Get-PodStatus doesn't consider an event of FailedScheduling as a failure
