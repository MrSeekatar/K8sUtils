TODO

1. The rollback of PlatformApi looks like it's due to it finding 3 pods to check status, but it only has 2?
Final status show 3 with one Unknown

2. The debug switch branch needs to be merged into this one. I have a worktree for that branch


Pending to running for 1/2
    4csqw Pending to running for 1/2
Checking pod 2/2 shows
    pfv45 has status of running at start then
    k5xrw starts as pending then once it gets to running it thinks 2/2 pods or ok, but pfv45 goes to unknown
